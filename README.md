Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry. is a branch of computer science used for developing, testing and maintaining software. The importance of software engineering in technology industry are as follows.Secondly , it enhance the development of new software sytem that can be used in differents industry sectors including health and finance industry.Software engineering help in testing of the established and new design software to measures its efficiency and realibility.
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.mastering complexity, Mastering process and Mastering machine
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.The three key milestone of software engineering evolution are ,planing is the first milestone which involve the process of identifying requirements ,the purpose and scope of the software that wil be designed or arleady designed.Secondly ,requirement analysis is the milestone which deals with identification the final user specification and third milestone is design which involves the  building of the framework. 
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.Linear and sequential, each phase is completed before moving on. Starting with waterfall methodology there is Low flexibility,changes are hard to incorporate once a phase is complete, Customer feedback comes late, after the product is developed andTesting is done at the end of the development process.While agile methodology is a Iterative and incremental, with multiple cycles (sprints) , High flexibility, adapts to changing requirements, Regular customer feedback is incorporated into every sprint and Testing is continuous and done after each iteration.
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.The following are their roles and responsibilities starting with Software Developer is responsibe for developing applications,programs and systems using programming languages and frameworks. Also maintaining and updating software to keep it functional. Quality Assurance Engineer has the following responsibilities to collaborate with stakeholders to understand and clarify software requirement.secondly ,  create development standards and procedures for the programmers to follow and lastly , confirmation of the software meets the requirement before deployment . and the lasts are responsibilities of Project Manager includes assembles and lead the software development team.discuss the project and it's requirement with the client and software developer, create blueprint for the project and lastly, tracking and communicating information regarding the project milestone
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.(IDE) is a software platform that facilitates the creation of other software applications by providing a space to write, compile, and debug code, sometimes with value-adding tools that reduce development efforts. eg Visual Studio Code (VSCode),it is importances includes ,
.it contains many intelligent features for automatically writing or editing the source code examples Python, increase programmer productivity by performing repeatable development tasks that are typically part of every code change and it  format the written text by automatically making some words bold or italic, or by using different font colors.



What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
